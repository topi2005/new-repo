    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Ntando Kumalo, I'm a 19 year old girl. I'm the last of 5 children. One of my favorite hobbies is reading but with academics and all, there simply isn't enough time to read as much as I'd like to BUT I always make time to watch anime. At the moment, I'm watching winx club and solo leveling.</p>

    <h3>Latest Project</h3>
    <p>I tried to do some school work during the holidays and it worked for a while, but I couldn't do it for the rest of the holidays because I was resting. However, my latest project is one we did last year. The wits competitive snake ai. My AI Snake was a smart pathfinding agent designed to compete in a strategic Snake game. It used a BFS-based Pathfinder to navigate the grid efficiently, avoiding obstacles, zombies, and enemy snakes while prioritizing food collection. The agent processed the game state—including snake positions, apples, and threats—through standard input, making real-time decisions to outmaneuver opponents. I also refined its collision detection logic to handle close encounters with other snakes, ensuring it could engage in competitive play.</p>
